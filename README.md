## Credits
I am far from a mathematician and did not design the protocol myself. The proofs used are rather complex in nature. I will do my best to explain its functionality, but please refer to the research papers on which this implementation is based as it does a far more complete job with explanation than I. **Note:** the paper's implementation uses the set of all real numbers as the cyclic group for simplicity. In this implementation, the cyclic group used is an elliptic curve.

[Implementing Zero-Knowledge Authentication with Zero Knowledge](https://ojs.pythonpapers.org/index.php/tppm/article/view/155) by Brandon Lum Jia Jun


## Purpose
Zero-Knowledge Proofs are undoubtedly the future of authentication security within various IT and application development industrires. The ability to verify the veracity of a claim (ex: proving that you know a secret password), without divulging any information about the claim itself (ex: passwords or hashes), allows for servers to guarantee secure AAA operations (authentication, authorization, and accounting) without exposing private information. `NoKnow` is an implementation of a [Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge Proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-interactive_zero-knowledge_proof) protocol specifically designed for verifying text-based secrets, which is ideal for passwords or other authentication means.


## How It Works
TODO: explain how it works

## API

The `noknow` Python API is meant to be simple and intuitive:

### Core Components

#### noknow.core.ZKParameters:
The parameters used to initialize the Elliptic Curve within the Zero-Knowledge crypto system.

    class ZKParameters(NamedTuple):
        """
        The parameters required for creating the Zero-Knowledge Cryptosystem
        """
        curve: str          # the name of the standardized elliptic curve to use for cyclic group point generation
        d: int              # the large prime number used to generate an elliptic curve point and as a modulo
        
#### noknow.core.ZKSignature:
A cryptographic public signature created from an Elliptic Curve and a user-provided secret (ex: a password) which should be stored by the server (along with the `ZKParameters` used) and can be used to validate future challenges.

    class ZKSignature(NamedTuple):
        """
        A cryptographic signature distinct from a hash that can be used to validate the same input in the future
        """
        params: ZKParameters  # the reference ZK parameters
        signature: int        # the calculated signature derived from the ZK curve and user secret


#### noknow.core.ZKChallenge:

    class ZKChallenge(NamedTuple):
        """
        A cryptographic challenge created by a user based on the signature (derived from the password) 
        """
        params: ZKParameters  # the reference ZK parameters
        token: int            # the server-provided random tokens
        c: int                # the hash derived from the signature, a random point, and the random token
        z: int                # a value derived from the random point and password hash
        
        
### Proof
 
The `ZKProof` class is the central component of `NoKnow` and its state (defined by `ZKParameters`) should be inherently known to both the Client (Prover) and Server (Verifier).
